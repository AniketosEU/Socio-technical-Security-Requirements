#Error Texts
#Social Task
Result_NoErrorsText=No consistency errors found
Result_NoErrorsDesc=Consistency analysis did not find any errors in the diagram

Result_NoActors_text=No actors in the diagram
Result_NoActors_desc=There are no actors drawn in the diagram, no consistency checks can be performed


Result_ContributionLoop_text=Contribution Loop
Result_ContributionLoop_desc=There is a cycle of contribution relationships, which contains inconsistent relationships

Result_DecomposedGoalDelegated_text=Goal "{0}" is decomposed and should not be delegated
Result_DecomposedGoalDelegated_desc=The language allows for delegation of leaf goals only, not upper level goals in the goal tree, consider revising either the goal tree or the delegation relationship

Result_DecomposedGoalCapability_text=Goal "{0}" is decomposed and should not have any capability specified
Result_DecomposedGoalCapability_desc=Capability is specified over leaf goals, therefore it should not be specified over higher level goals, consider revising either the goal tree or information regarding the capability 

Result_DlegatedGoalPartOfDecomposition_text=Goal "{0}" has been delegated and is a part of a decomposition 
Result_DlegatedGoalPartOfDecomposition_desc=The delegatee "{0}" considers the delegated goal "{1}" as a subgoal of its own goal "{2}"

Result_DlegationLoop_text=Delegation loop
Result_DlegationLoop_desc=There is a delegation cycle created by the delegation of goal "{0}", which is a subgoal of "{1}", back to "{2}"

Result_NegativeContributionBetweenAND_text=Negative contribution between two AND subgoals
Result_NegativeContributionBetweenAND_desc=There is a negative contribution between goal "{0}" and goal "{1}" which are AND subgoals of goal "{2}" in the scope of {3}

Result_SingleDecomposition_text=Goal "{0}" is decomposed in 1 subgoal, but it should be decomposed in at least 2 subgoals
Result_SingleDecomposition_desc=Goals are decomposed in at least two subgoals, while goal "{0}" has only 1 subgoal specified, specify at least another subgoal  



#Information Tasks
Result_DocumentPartOfCicle_text=Documents "{0}" are inside a part Of cycle;
Result_DocumentPartOfCicle_desc=There is a cycle of part of relationships between documents "{0}", since part of relationships are drawn "{1}"

Result_InformationPartOfCicle_text=Informations "{0}" are inside a part Of cycle
Result_InformationPartOfCicle_desc=There is a cycle of part of relationships between informations "{0}", since part of relationships are drawn "{1}"


# we could enumerate the various documents in the cycle here 
Result_InformationNoOwner_text=Information "{0}" has no owner
Result_InformationNoOwner_desc=There is no ownership relationship specified towards information "{0}" from any actor 


# we could enumerate the various information in the cycle here, in the phrase I considered there could be 3 information in the cycle, there could be 2 or even more   
#Autorisation Tasks
Result_AuthorisationsInformationNoOwner_text=Information "{0}" is not owned by anyone and "{1}" is giving authorisations for it
Result_AuthorisationsInformationNoOwner_desc=There is no ownership relationship specified for information "{0}" and yet "{1}" is passing authorisations for "{0}" 


Result_AuthorisationsValidityEmpty_text=The authorisation from "{0}" to "{1}" has no information and no operation specified
Result_AuthorisationsValidityEmpty_desc=Authorisations are granted from one actor to another on some information, so at least an information and one operation should be specified in this authorisation relationship

#Result_AuthorisationsInformationWrongOwner_text=Information "{0}" is owned by "{1}", but "{2}" is giving authorisations for it"
#Result_AuthorisationsInformationWrongOwner_desc=
Result_AuthorisationsValidityNoInformation_text=The authorisation from "{0}" to "{1}" has no information specified
Result_AuthorisationsValidityNoInformation_desc=Authorisations are granted from one actor to another on some information, so at least an information should be specified in this authorisation relationship

Result_AuthorisationsValidityNoOperations_text=Authorisation from "{0}" to "{1}" have no operation specified"
Result_AuthorisationsValidityNoOperations_desc=Authorisations are granted from one actor to another on some information, specifying the operations that can be performed over that information, therefore at least one operation should be specified in this authorisation relationship

Result_DuplicateAuthorisation_text=Duplicate authorisations from "{0}" to "{1}" 
Result_DuplicateAuthorisation_desc=There are duplicate authorisations from "{0}" to "{1}", which can be merged in a single authorisation relationship
