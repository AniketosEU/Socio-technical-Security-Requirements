#Result_Sod_Role_Violation_desc=

Result_Sod_Goal_Violation_text=There is a separation of duty violation with respect to the goals "{1}" and "{2}"
Result_Sod_Goal_Violation_desc=Goal "{0}" and goal "{1}" should not be achieved by the same actor, since a separation of duty is expressed between these two goals, but "{2}" wants to achieve them both 
# 2 is either the agent playing both roles or the role having these goals in its scope when there's no agent playing it 

Result_Cod_Goal_Violation_text=There is a binding of duty violation with respect to the  goals "{1}" and "{2}"
Result_Cod_Goal_Violation_desc=Goal "{0}" and goal "{1}" should be achieved by the same actor, since a binding of duty is expressed between these goals, but there is no actor to achieve them both, "{2}" wants to achieve {3} but not "{4}" 
# perhaps here we should make more explicit the cases 
# it could be that there is no agent
# or that there is one agent only, playing one of the roles, but not the other, and we could refer to it
# so 2 refers to the agent, ? means that if 0 is the goal it can achieve, the second ? should be 1 and vice versa 

Result_Cod_Goal_Violation_NoAgent_text= Possible violation of binding of duties between goals, there is no agent playing the roles
Result_Cod_Goal_Violation_NoAgent_desc=Goal "{0}" and goal "{1}" should be achieved by the same actor, since a binding of duty is expressed between these goals, but there is no actor to achieve them both 
# ok, I guess this is the first case I mentioned above, so I'm letting the description general like this 


Result_OrganizationalConsSodTreeGoal_text=Invalid SoD constraint between goals "{0}" and "{1}"

Result_OrganizationalConsBodTreeGoal_desc=Binding of duties constraints cannot be specified between goals and their subgoals, consider revising the goal tree or the BoD constraints 

Result_AgentPlaySod_text=Agent "{0}" should not play role "{1}" and role "{2}" at the same time
Result_AgentPlaySod_desc=Agent "{0}" should not play role "{1}" and role "{2}" at the same time, since a separation of duty constraint is specified between role "{1}" and role "{2}" defining these roles as incompatible

Result_AgentNotPlayBod_text=Agent "{0}" should play both role "{1}" and role "{2}"
Result_AgentNotPlayBod_desc=Agent "{0}" should play both role "{1}" and role "{2}", since a binding of duty constraint is specified between role "{1}" and role "{2}" requiring these roles to be played in combination
