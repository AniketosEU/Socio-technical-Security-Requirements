Socio-technical-Security-Requirements
=====================================

Short description
-----------------
Socio-technical-Security-Requirements Package consists in a software called STS-Tool, enriched with a plugin, called TRM (Thread Repository Module).

STS-Tool (Socio-Technical Security modelling Tool) is a standalone application that enables the creation of security requirements models in STS-ml. STS-Tool supports the validation of a diagram via consistency analysis and security analysis.  The tool provides a feature for the automatic derivation of security requirements, threats propagation analysis and the generation of a security requirements document. STS-Tool is written in Java and is based on the Eclipse RCP Engine. The current version of STS-Tool (v1.3.3) is ready for public use.

Overview 
--------
STS-ml (Socio-Technical Security modelling language) is an actor-and goal-oriented security requirements modelling language. STS-ml includes high-level organisational concepts such as actor, goal, delegation, etc. Importantly, it relates security requirements to interaction, allowing actors to express their expectations regarding security over the interactions they have with other actors. 

STS-Tool is the modelling and analysis support for STS-ml. As such, it enables the creation of STS-ml diagrams. 

Moreover, it:
1. allows the automated derivation of security requirements from a STS-ml diagram; 
2. supports *automated reasoning* in terms of 
	* consistency  analysis: well-formedness analysis of the STS-ml diagram designed 
security analysis: verify (i) if the security requirements specification is consistent, that is, no requirements are potentially conflicting; (ii) if the diagram 	
	* allows the satisfaction of the specified security requirements. ; 
	* risk threats: identify threat propagation over actors’ assets

In the Aniketos approach, STS-Tool is used to conduct security requirements engineering that precedes the design of secure service compositions.

Requirements
------------
STS-Tool is available for Windows (XP, Vista and 7), Linux (Gtk) and Apple OS X operating systems. Java 6 needs to be installed.
