#Error Texts
Result_NoErrorsText=No security errors found
Result_NoErrorsDesc=Security analysis did not find any violations

# Social view 
Result_NoDelegation_Violation_text={0}% of the cases. {1} makes an unauthorised redelegation of goal {2}
# 1 is actor, 2 is goal --- could be the goal or any of its subgoals 
Result_NoDelegation_Violation_desc={0} has expressed a no_delegation security need over the delegation of the goal {1} to {2}, and yet {2} is re-delegating goal {3} to {4}
# 2 and 3 are actors --- role or agent be it 

# Violation of Granted  Authorisations 
Result_NonDisclosure_Violation_text={0}% of the cases. {1} makes an unauthorised distribution of information {2}
# 1 is actor, 2 is information
Result_NonDisclosure_Violation_desc={0} has required {1} non_disclosure of information {2}, but {1} is distributing {2} to {3} by providing document {4}
# 0, 1, 3 are actors 
# 2 is information 
# 4 is document

Result_NonUsage_Violation_text={0}% of the cases. {1} makes an unauthorised usage of information {2}
# 1 is actor, 2 is information
Result_NonUsage_Violation_desc={0} has required {1} non_usage of information {2}, but {1} can use {2} since there is a need relationship from its goal {3} towards document {4} representing {2}
# 0, 1 are actors, 2 is information, 3 is goal, 4 is document 

Result_NonModification_Violation_text={0}% of the cases. {1} makes an unauthorised modification of information {2} 
# 1 is actor, 2 is information
Result_NonModification_Violation_desc={0} has required {1} non_modification of information {2}, but {1} can modify {2} since there is a modify relationship from its goal {3} towards document {4} representing {2}
# 0, 1 are actors, 2 is information, 3 is goal, 4 is document

Result_NonProduction_Violation_text={0}% of the cases. {1} makes an unauthorised production of information {2} 
# 1 is actor, 2 is information
Result_NonProduction_Violation_desc={0} has required {1} non_production of information {2}, but {1} can produce {2} since there is a produce relationship from its goal {3} towards document {4} representing {2}
# 0, 1 are actors, 2 is information, 3 is goal, 4 is document

Result_NTK_Violation_text={0}% of the cases. {1} violates its authority performing operations in another goal scope 
# 1 is actor
Result_NTK_Violation_desc={0} has required {1} need_to_know over information {2}, requiring {1} not to perform any operations over {2} other than for {3}, but {1} can perform operations over {2} for {4}, which is different from {2} and is not a subgoal of {2}
# 0, 1 are actors, 2 is information, 3, 4 are goals
# actually here I would want to make it more explicit, rather than just say operations 
# so if there is need, modify, or produce, we could explicitly refer to that relationship, what do you think?

# Authority Violation
Result_Authority_Violation_text={0}% of the cases. {1} violates its authority passing permissions without having the authority to transfer rights
# 1 is actor
Result_Authority_Violation_desc={0} has no authority to transfer authority to other actors, but it still authorises {1}
# 0, 1 are actors 

#Unauthorised Delegation of Rights 
Result_Unath_Del_Usage_Violation_text={0}% of the cases. {1} violates its authority passing permission to use, in an unauthorised way
# 1 is actor 
Result_Unath_Del_Usage_Violation_desc={0} has no authority to use information {1}, but still authorises {2} to use {1}
# 0, 2 are actors 
# 1 is information 

Result_Unath_Del_Mod_Violation_text={0}% of the cases. {1} violates its authority passing permission to modify, in an unauthorised way
# 1 is actor 
Result_Unath_Del_Mod_Violation_desc={0} has no authority to modify information {1}, but still authorises {2} to modify {1}
# 0, 2 are actors 
# 1 is information 

Result_Unath_Del_Prod_Violation_text={0}% of the cases. {1} violates its authority passing permission to produce, in an unauthorised way
# 1 is actor 
Result_Unath_Del_Prod_Violation_desc={0} has no authority to produce information {1}, but still authorises {2} to produce {1}
# 0, 2 are actors 
# 1 is information 

Result_Unath_Del_Dist_Violation_text={0}% of the cases. {1} violates its authority passing permission to distribute, in an unauthorised way
# 1 is actor
Result_Unath_Del_Dist_Violation_desc={0} has no authority to distribute information {1}, but still authorises {2} to distribute {1}
# 0, 2 are actors 
# 1 is information 


# Organisational Constraints related 
#Result_Sod_Role_Violation_text=Violation : {0}% : {1}
#Result_Sod_Role_Violation_desc=

Result_Sod_Goal_Violation_text={0}% of the cases. There is a separation of duty violation with respect to the goals {1} and {2}
Result_Sod_Goal_Violation_desc=Goal {0} and goal {1} should not be achieved by the same actor, since a separation of duty is expressed between these two goals, but {2} wants to achieve them both 
# 2 is either the agent playing both roles or the role having these goals in its scope when there's no agent playing it 

Result_Cod_Goal_Violation_text={0}% of the cases. There is a binding of duty violation with respect to the  goals {1} and {2}
Result_Cod_Goal_Violation_desc=Goal {0} and goal {1} should be achieved by the same actor, since a binding of duty is expressed between these goals, but there is no actor to achieve them both, {2} wants to achieve {3} but not {4} 
# perhaps here we should make more explicit the cases 
# it could be that there is no agent
# or that there is one agent only, playing one of the roles, but not the other, and we could refer to it
# so 2 refers to the agent, ? means that if 0 is the goal it can achieve, the second ? should be 1 and vice versa 

Result_Cod_Goal_Violation_NoAgent_text= {0}% of the cases. Possible violation of binding of duties between goals, there is no agent playing the roles
Result_Cod_Goal_Violation_NoAgent_desc=Goal {0} and goal {1} should be achieved by the same actor, since a binding of duty is expressed between these goals, but there is no actor to achieve them both 
# ok, I guess this is the first case I mentioned above, so I'm letting the description general like this
